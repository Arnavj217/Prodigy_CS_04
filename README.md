Keylogger (Educational Use Only) is a basic program designed to demonstrate how keystroke logging works by capturing and recording keyboard inputs and saving them to a local file. Developed using Python, this tool logs each key pressed on the system in real time. The project is intended strictly for educational and ethical purposes, such as understanding system monitoring, keyboard event handling, and cybersecurity awareness. It must only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. This open-source implementation serves as a learning resource for students and developers interested in computer security, with a strong emphasis on responsible usage.
